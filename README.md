# 🧑‍💼 HR Employee Performance & Attrition Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing employee data to understand key factors influencing **job performance, satisfaction, and attrition (employee turnover)**. By applying data analysis and machine learning techniques, the goal is to provide actionable insights for human resources management.

## ✨ Key Features & Goals

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Clean, preprocess, and visualize the HR dataset to understand the distribution of various employee attributes.
* **Identify Drivers of Attrition:** Determine which factors (e.g., job role, satisfaction, salary, years at company) have the strongest correlation with an employee leaving the company.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Build a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest) to predict which employees are most likely to leave, enabling proactive intervention.
* **Insight Generation:** Deliver clear, data-driven recommendations to improve employee retention and satisfaction.

## 🚀 Technologies and Libraries

This analysis is built using Python and the following key libraries:

* **Python:** (Specify version, e.g., 3.10+)
* **Data Manipulation:** `pandas`, `numpy`
* **Data Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (for creating insightful charts and dashboards)
* **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn` (for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation)
* **Notebooks:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab (Specify which one)
